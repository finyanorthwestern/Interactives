      <h1>Latvia's Population Crisis</h1>
      <h3>By Finya Swai</h3>
      <p>
        Over the last few decades, tens of thousands of young Latvians have left
        for better opportunities abroad. The country’s population, once nearly
        2.7 million in the early 1990s, has declined to 1.8 million today.
        Emigration rates are skyrocketing, birth rates are at an all time low,
        and Latvia has become one of the fastest-shrinking nations in the world.
        This population crisis threatens not only the country’s economy, but
        also its very identity.

        Latvia’s population is expected to decrease by

        The population appears to peak around the early 1990s, but drastically
        decreases as Latvia gains its independence from the Soviet Union in
        1991. At the time of its Soviet occupation, many Russians settled in
        Latvia and had children. After the war and the country’s independence,
        however, many Russians left, causing the population to decrease. To this
        day, the country has not been able to fully recover.

        Economic instability, particularly in rural areas, has driven many young
        Latvians abroad for higher paying jobs. Since Latvia’s ascension to the
        EU in 2004, the country has lost a fifth of its population. While the
        average monthly salary in Latvia has increased to €1,180, it’s still
        comparatively behind other EU nations. Countries like Sweden, the United
        Kingdom and Germany offer higher wages and better living standards. They
        have average monthly salaries of €3,000, €2,500 and €4,300 respectively.
        With easier movement within the EU, the choice is easy for many young
        Latvians.

        In 2023 less than 14,500 babies were born in Latvia, while 28,000 people died
        that same year. That was the lowest number of recorded births in the
        past hundred years.

        Women are giving birth later, with changing attitudes towards women’s
        roles in the household and in the workforce heavily contributing to
        this. Prior to the country’s Soviet occupation, it was common for women
        to get married in their early 20s, stay home and raise children. Now,
        many Latvian women are choosing to have children much later, or not have
        them at all.

        This story was researched through various interviews from subject matter
        experts and official data from the Latvian government’s statistics
        portal.
