<h1>Latvia's Population Crisis</h1>
        <p>Over the last few decades, tens of thousands of young Latvians have left for better opportunities abroad. The country’s population, once nearly 2.7 million in the early 1990s, has declined to 1.8 million today. Emigration rates are skyrocketing, birth rates are at an all time low, and Latvia has become one of the fastest-shrinking nations in the world. This population crisis threatens not only the country’s economy, but also its very identity.</p>

        <p>Economic instability, particularly in rural areas, has driven many young Latvians abroad for higher paying jobs. Since Latvia’s ascension to the EU in 2004, the country has lost a fifth of its population. While the average monthly salary in Latvia has increased to €1,180, it’s still comparatively behind other EU nations. Countries like Sweden, the United Kingdom and Germany offer higher wages and better living standards. They have average monthly salaries of €3,000, €2,500 and €4,300 respectively. With easier movement within the EU, the choice is easy for many young Latvians.</p>
